= Getting started with Chutney

image::https://github.com/ledoyen/chutney-project-template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg[build]

== Setup your project

* Use this template (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template[documentation])

image::doc/use_this_template.png[]

* Git clone your new GitHub repository (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository[documentation])

* Execute scenarios : `./mvnw test`
+
Or, if you are a Windows user: `mvnw.bat test`

For the next section, we recommend that you open the project with a Java IDE such as https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download[IntelliJ].

== image:doc/seven.png[] Whaaat's in the booox ?

A link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/HelloScenarios.kt[sample scenario], that asserts that the title of the web page `www.google.fr` is exactly `Google`.

Except that if you look closely, there is no reference to `www.google.fr` in this scenario.
Instead, there is a reference to an abstract _target_: `search_engine`.

This reference allows the same scenario to be executed against different environments.

== Creating another environment

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/Environments.kt[Environments.kt] file.

* Duplicate the existing `google_fr` and `environment_fr` values as `google_en` and `environment_en`

* Now replace the website extension by `.com` instead of `.fr`

Newly created code should look like

[source,kotlin]
----
val google_en = ChutneyTarget(name = "search_engine", url = "https://www.google.com")

val environment_en = ChutneyEnvironment(
    name = "The English World Wide Web",
    description = "The World Wide Web, mostly",
    targets = listOf(
        google_en
    )
)
----

== Using multiple environments

* Open the link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/RunHelloTests.kt[RunHelloTests.kt] file

* Replace `environment_fr` by `environment_en` and run the test

The same scenario without a single modification was run on a different environment.

[TIP]
====
Usually, an *environment* represents the different stages used to qualify a software, such as *local*, *dev*, *staging* or *pre-production*.
====

* Now, if we want our scenario to run on each environment, we can take advantage of `@ParameterizedTest` supplied by JUnit Jupiter

* Modify the test such as the following and re-run the test

[source,kotlin]
----
private companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        fun environments() = Stream.of(
            Arguments.of(environment_fr),
            Arguments.of(environment_en)
        )
    }


    @ParameterizedTest
    @MethodSource("environments")
    fun `search title is displayed`(environment: ChutneyEnvironment) {
        Launcher("target/chutney/reports").run(search_title_scenario, environment)
    }
----

== Starting with a Chutney server

Until then, we worked with the embedded version of Chutney which does not need a server.

However, most of software pieces are built with team work.
In this case, we want to share scenarios, track their executions and allow people unfamiliar with coding to tinker around.

To allow that, Chutney provides a server version, composed of the execution engine and a UI.

* Start Chutney locally by running `docker compose up&` (Docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/[documentation]).

* Access the UI at the address: https://localhost

* Login using the default credentials admin / admin

* Create your first scenario in the UI by clicking on the pen icon in the upper right image:doc/edit_icon.png[]

* Save it as is, by clicking on the save icon image:doc/save_icon.png[]

* Run it by clicking on the run button image:doc/run_button.png[] and choosing the environment on which to run the scenario against

[TIP]
====
The dockerized Chutney already knows the aforementioned environments, as the folder `server_conf` is mounted as its root directory in the link:docker-compose.yml[`docker-compose.yml`] file.
====

== Synchronizing Kotlin scenarios with a server

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/SynchronizeToServer.kt[SynchronizeToServer.kt] file
* Execute the `main` function to synchronize any change made locally to the running server
