= Getting started with Chutney

image::https://github.com/chutney-testing/chutney-project-template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg[build]

== Setup your project

* Use this template (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template[documentation])

image::doc/use_this_template.png[]

* Git clone your new GitHub repository (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository[documentation])

* Execute scenarios :
    ** `./mvnw clean verify`
    ** `./gradlew clean test`
+
Or, if you are a Windows user:
    ** `mvnw.bat clean verify`
    ** `gradlew.bat clean test`

For the next section, we recommend that you open the project with a Java IDE such as https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download[IntelliJ].

A link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/ScenarioExample.kt[sample scenarios], in there you will find 4 scenarios :

* One call a search engine and another one call a chutney website
    ** They both show how to reference a target, decoupled from any environment (see next section)
       If you look closely, there is no reference to `google.fr` or `google.com` nor any other URLs.
       Instead, there is a reference to an abstract _target_: `search_engine` or `chutney`.
       This reference allows the same scenario to run on different environments without being couple to technical details such as URLs, authentication etc.
    ** The first scenario also shows how to do an assertion from a "business" point of view, using a separate step
    ** The second scenario shows how to do an assertion from a "technical" point of view, using an inner step validation
* One scenario call an non existing website
    ** It is called in link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/LauncherTest.kt[LauncherTest] to show how to expect a step failure using the Launcher
* The last scenario shows how to pass parameters
    ** It is called in link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/ChutneyJunitEngineTest.kt[ChutneyJunitEngineTest]

== Using multiple environment

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/Environments.kt[Environments.kt] file.

* Look at the `en_search_engine` and `fr_search_engine` values. The later is a copy, so they share the same name: `"search_engine"` but have different URL.
Then, they are set in different environment, respectively `english_web` and `french_web`.

* With the same scenario, you can execute the http get action on target `search_engine` on two different environments

[source,kotlin]
----
 HttpGetAction(
    target = "search_engine",
    uri = "/",
    validations = mapOf("request accepted" to "status == 200".spEL()),
    outputs = mapOf("resultJson" to "body".spEL())
)
----


== Executing on multiple environments

* Open the link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/ChutneyJunitEngineTest.kt[ChutneyJunitEngineTest.kt] file

* Replace `english_web` by `french_web` and run the test

The same scenario without a single modification was run on a different environment.

[TIP]
====
Usually, an *environment* represents the different stages used to qualify a software, such as *local*, *dev*, *staging* or *pre-production*.
====

* Now, if we want our scenario to run on each environment, we can take advantage of `@ParameterizedTest` supplied by JUnit Jupiter

* Look at example in link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/LauncherTest.kt[LauncherTest.kt]

== Starting with a Chutney server

Until then, we worked with the embedded version of Chutney which does not need a server. This fits well within a CI or for a developer local setup.

However, building software is most often a teamwork !
Doing so, you will need to collaborate and share scenarios, track their executions and allow functional and business analyst to review and be involved in testing their product.

To allow that, Chutney provides a server version, composed of the execution engine and a UI.

* Start Chutney locally by running `docker compose up&` (Docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/[documentation]).

* Access the UI at the address: https://localhost

* Login using the default credentials admin / admin

* Create your first scenario in the UI by clicking on the pen icon in the upper right

* Save it as is, by clicking on the save button

* Run it by clicking on the run button and choosing the environment on which to run the scenario against

[TIP]
====
The dockerized Chutney already knows the aforementioned environments, as the folder `chutney_environments` is mounted as its root directory in the link:docker-compose.yml[`docker-compose.yml`] file.
====

== Synchronizing Kotlin scenarios with a server

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/SynchronizeToServer.kt[SynchronizeToServer.kt] file
* Execute the `main` function to synchronize any change made locally to the running server

[TIP]
====
To synchronize a scenario, the test code has to share an id with the server in order to know what scenario to update. The id is provided in the constructor of Scenario: `Scenario(id = 1, title = "Search title displays")`.
