= Getting started with Chutney

image::https://github.com/chutney-testing/chutney-project-template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg[build]

== Setup your project

* Use this template (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template[documentation])

image::doc/use_this_template.png[]

* Git clone your new GitHub repository (complete https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository[documentation])

* Execute scenarios : `./mvnw test`
+
Or, if you are a Windows user: `mvnw.bat test`

For the next section, we recommend that you open the project with a Java IDE such as https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download[IntelliJ].

== image:doc/seven.png[] Whaaat's in the booox ?

A link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/HelloScenarios.kt[sample scenario], that asserts that the title of the web page `www.google.fr` is exactly `Google`.

Except that if you look closely, there is no reference to `www.google.fr` in this scenario.
Instead, there is a reference to an abstract _target_: `search_engine`.

This reference allows the same scenario to be executed against different environments.

== Using multiple environment

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/Environments.kt[Environments.kt] file.

* Look at the  `google_fr` and `environment_fr` values and  `google_en` and `environment_en` values. They share the same name: `"search_engine"`

* With the same scenario, you can execute the http get task on target `search_engine` on two different environments

[source,kotlin]
----
 HttpGetTask(
    target = "search_engine",
    uri = "/",
    validations = mapOf("request accepted" to "status == 200".spEL()),
    outputs = mapOf("resultJson" to "body".spEL())
)
----


== Executing on multiple environments

* Open the link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/RunHelloTests.kt[RunHelloTests.kt] file

* Replace `environment_fr` by `environment_en` and run the test

The same scenario without a single modification was run on a different environment.

[TIP]
====
Usually, an *environment* represents the different stages used to qualify a software, such as *local*, *dev*, *staging* or *pre-production*.
====

* Now, if we want our scenario to run on each environment, we can take advantage of `@ParameterizedTest` supplied by JUnit Jupiter

* Look at example in link:src/test/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/RunHelloMultipleEnvironmentTests.kt[RunHelloMultipleEnvironmentTests.kt]

== Starting with a Chutney server

Until then, we worked with the embedded version of Chutney which does not need a server. This fits well within a CI or for a developer local setup.

However, building software is most often a teamwork !
Doing so, you will need to collaborate and share scenarios, track their executions and allow functional and business analyst to review and be involved in testing their product.

To allow that, Chutney provides a server version, composed of the execution engine and a UI.

* Start Chutney locally by running `docker compose up&` (Docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/[documentation]).

* Access the UI at the address: https://localhost

* Login using the default credentials admin / admin

* Create your first scenario in the UI by clicking on the pen icon in the upper right

* Save it as is, by clicking on the save button

* Run it by clicking on the run button and choosing the environment on which to run the scenario against

[TIP]
====
The dockerized Chutney already knows the aforementioned environments, as the folder `chutney_environments` is mounted as its root directory in the link:docker-compose.yml[`docker-compose.yml`] file.
====

== Synchronizing Kotlin scenarios with a server

* Open the link:src/main/kotlin/com/chutneytesting/hello/SynchronizeToServer.kt[SynchronizeToServer.kt] file
* Execute the `main` function to synchronize any change made locally to the running server

[TIP]
====
To synchronize a scenario, the test code has to share an id with the server in order to know what scenario to update. The id is provided in the constructor of Scenario: `Scenario(id = 1, title = "Search title displays")`.
